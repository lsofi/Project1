    <h3>THE BAND</h3>
    <h4>We love music</h4>
    <p>We have created a fictional band website. Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer-songwriter and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, 
        the band went through a succession of drummers before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. </p>
